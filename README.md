## ‚ùì What is MAVERICK? What were our Design Decisions?
* MAVERICK is a indie game created in under 48 hours for the Borderlands Glitch GameJam.
* It is unofficially based on the Top Gun movie released in 1986.
* MAVERICK is a 2D Shoot 'Em Up, inspired by arcade titles such as 1942 and Galaga.

### (Unofficial) License Choice
* Since the prompt of this GameJam was to choose a movie or TV show from the late 80's through early 90's to base our game off of, we started by making a list as a team of what media we enjoyed from the era.
* We took team votes to decide which games were feasible given the time constraints/looked fun to create, then recursively struck bad ones off of our list.
* Some titles discussed, their potential genre, and the reason they were struck are:

| *Title* | *Genre* | *Struck Reason* |
|----------|----------|--------|
| The Evil Dead (1981) | Survival Horror | Too many unique Assets to make something nice. |
| Indiana Jones & The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) | 2D Platformer | Too many unique Assets to make something nice. |
| Karate Kid (1984) | Fighting Game | Too many unique animations, not our forte since were all in CS first, artists second. |
| Back to the Future (1985) | 2D Platformer/Driving Game | Lack of Interest. |
| [‚≠ê] Top Gun (1986) | 2D Shooter/Bullet Hell | Won The Vote! |
| Space Balls (1987) | Ship Simulator | Too much code to make a fun simulation. |
| Forest Gump (1994) | Endless Runner | Lack of Interest. |

### Naming Conventions
* Due to the rules stating that we were *NOT* allowed to directly adapt the movie, we chose to make our game a prequel to the original Top Gun Film, when the main character Pete ‚ÄúMaverick‚Äù Mitchell was still in Flight School, using a simulator.
* The name of the game, MAVERICK, was chosen to satirize the weird naming conventions that are tied to movie franchises like Rocky and Rambo. (Such as Rocky 6 being called ‚ÄúRocky Balboa‚Äù and Rambo 4 being called just ‚ÄúRambo‚Äù).
* This made our game fit neatly into Top Gun's Timeline, with it now being:
* MAVERICK -> Top Gun -> Top Gun: Maverick.

## üéûÔ∏è Video Demonstration.

* A video demonstrating a full run of the one level we completed for our vertical slice was recorded by Gilbert for this Github Repo.
* Since it is too big to upload here, it can be found at this link:

* Here's a fun photo of our demo station at the GameJam as well. :)

## üïπÔ∏è SteamOS Integration.

* Since Maverick was made playable on both standard computers and the Steam Deck, artwork was created so that it wouldn't look out of place next to other video games.

* It is a great source of pride that our team's game is able to sit next to games that were part of both our childhood and adulthood.
* If you would like to use these artworks for your copy of MAVERICK, please look at the [SteamGridAssets](https://github.com/Azaze7/MAVERICK/tree/main/SteamGridAssets "Steam Grid Artwork") folder. :)

## ‚úÇÔ∏è The Cutting Room Floor.

* Due to the strict timing of the Game Jam, we were unable to fully complete our original vision of MAVERICK.
* MAVERICK ended up having to be a single level, with the second level being completely struck.

## üö™ Closing Thoughts.
> "Coding Maverick was great experience in using C#. I learned a lot as the main coder for the project, as Unity was refusing to compile for everyone else's computer on the first day of development. However, I still think sometimes, *Why can a 2D Sprite flip the in the Z-Plane?*" -William Dunlap

> "Participating in this Game Jam was as fun as playing any videogame. All the collective knowledge our team had acquired was channeled into something creative, which was a refreshing change from our usual grind of homework. I found myself wearing many hats during this competition; coordinating our team, coding menus, and creating art assets; but because I had people I could trust, I never got too overwhelmed. Despite our short timeline, our collective sleep deprivation, and other life obligations popping up, our team's passion never faltered. Atlas Development turned caffeine into code, and I loved every minute of it." - Gilbert I. Guzman

> "Our team had a decent amount of hiccups due to needing to learn how to use the Unity engine within the 48 hours given, but it was a fun experience. Each member of Atlas Development seems to be still willing to continue developing Maverick to get the extra levels done. I think that says a lot about our teams dedication." - Dante Lopez

> "The Game Jam was a great experience. Collaborating with a team where everyone contributed with their best skills was amazing, especially when compared to a course project where everyone was at a different skill level. I was extremely satisfied with the final product despite the cuts that had to be made and I am interested in following up with the team to see what else we could make." - Jesus Torres 

> "Atlas Development made this Game Jam an extraordinary experience. It was great to gain valuable insight into what game development is like behind the scenes. Our team was able to make a fun, playable project within a few short days, which I think speaks to the hard work everyone put in. Despite the multitude of tasks I undertook to keep the team on track (Atlas Development was my name idea), the unwaviering passion of my team has motivated me to push further. I hope more of my teams in the future are like Atlas." - Zachary Wittmann
